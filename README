How directories are organized ?
------------------------------

The sub-directory "powerpc" contains the PowerPC750 simulator (written using SystemC).
The sub-directory "ppcemul" contains the PowerPC emulator.
Source are in "src" directories.
Libraries are in "lib" directories.
includes are in "include" directories.
binary executables are in "bin" directories.

Which files are built by the makefile ?
--------------------------------------

The PowerPC750 simulator (executable) : powerpc/bin/powerpc
The PowerPC Emulator (executable) : ppcemul/bin/ppcemul
The PowerPC Emulator library : ppcemul/lib/libppcemul.a

How to build both the emulator and the simulator ?
-------------------------------------------------

1) Edit powerpc/src/Makefile : make the SYSTEMC_DIR variable point on the SystemC Directory.

2) Go on the top level directory and run make.
